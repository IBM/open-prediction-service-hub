# Miniloan prediction micro service

A simple example of ML running microservice for real time machine learning based on Python, Flask, scikit-learn and Docker.
On request arrival for prediction, a Random Forest Classification model is loaded and run to predict a loan payment default.
Input parameters describing the loan are passed as HTTP parameters. Prediction is returned by the service.

## Build the ML microservice
```console
docker build . -t miniloanpredictionservice  -f ./Dockerfile
```
## Run the ML microservice
```console
docker run -p 3000:5000 -d miniloanpredictionservice 
```
Your predictive service is ready to predict on the 127.0.0.1:3000 port.
Note that you can run the server without Docker by starting main.py on your local environment. In this case adress will be 0.0.0.0:5000.

## Check
```console
docker ps miniloanpredictionservice 
```
You should see a running container for miniloanpredictionservice image.

## Go to the OpenAPI descriptor page
The microservice publishes its REST methods through the OpenAPI standard.
You navidate to the OpenAPI page at the root of the wepp application.
```console
http://127.0.0.1:3000/ 
```
You should see a SwaggerUI layout listing the exposed REST methods.

Open the predictive method.
![Flow](../docs/images/ml-model-static-hosting-openapi-screen-2.png "Predictive method")

Fill input parameters in the UI to execute the REST endpoint.
![Flow](../docs/images/ml-model-static-hosting-openapi-screen-3.png "Prediction inputs")

After hitting the execute button you then gets the following screen.
![Flow](../docs/images/ml-model-static-hosting-openapi-screen-4.png "Prediction results")

Congratulations! You obtained a risk score computed by the scikit-learn ML model.
In the JSON response you see the probability of a payment default.

You can conduct other tests in the OpenAPI window, OpenAPI generated clients or through a curl command.

## Summary
You have experimented a lightweight approach to host a scikit-learn ML model and expose it through a REST method.
The Docker image includes the ML model prepared by a data scientist and shared as a pickle file.

Next step will consist in consuming the predictive REST method from an IBM Automation engine running your business logic.
