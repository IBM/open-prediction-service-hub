# Technology Compatibility Kit (TCK)

This is a tool that will allow to verify that an Open Prediction Service implementation is correctly responding in all the defined endpoints.

## Usage

install requirements, run tests.

Run `pytest` with option `--url OPS_URL` if you don't want to test the default url `http://localhost:8080` used in our sample docker images.
