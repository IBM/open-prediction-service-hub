# Machine Learning model creation

Two examples are given for model generation, `iris-svc.py` and `miniloan-linear-svc.py`.

Structure of ml model:
```
ml_model.pkl
    └── python dict
        ├── ML model
        └── model configurations
```

For instance, `ML model` can be a trained classifier and `model configurations` contains
associated configuration(e.g like [this](../../README.md#Configuration-example-for-miniloan-classification))
